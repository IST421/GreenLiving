     <h1> Mission Statement </h1>
    <p>
       
         <h2>What We Do? <br /></h2>
Mission Compostable is a nonprofit group of individuals dedicated to utilizing modern web development skills, in order to design and develop a functional web page for those seeking to live a greener lifestyle. Our website will be able to be used for a multitude of tasks to promote green living.
 <h2>How We Do It?<br /></h2>
Greenhouse gases have been one of the most talked about issues in the 2000’s. Data, solutions and other information regarding them are wide and plentiful. We gather and collect data from various sources and determine ways that allow users to undergo greener living while still being able to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.
 <h2>What Value do We Bring?<br /></h2>
We allow users to track and store information on their CO2 emissions. We do this by giving them a calculator that tracks gases that can accumulate from home, driving, flying, food and waste. Users will be able to track said information while we give solutions on how to reduce their CO2 emissions.
 <h2>Who We Do it for?<br /></h2>
Our primary concern is for the environment. Without a sustainable and clean environment, there may negative consequences to human health, energy supply, the ecosystem, etc. In the long run this could affect future generations as well. Mission Compostable seeks to make people aware to this issue and encourages the people of today to leave less of a carbon footprint for the sake of the environment and future generations who live in it.
